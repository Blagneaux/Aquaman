## Sensor Dimensioning
The initial phase of this research focuses on the dimensioning of sensors intended for use in aquatic environments to estimate the pressure generated by a swimming fish. This process involves utilizing a Julia library developed by Gabriel D. Weymouth, named WaterLily. WaterLily enables the generation of a fish's desired shape and the parametrization of its speed and motion in a fluid. Consequently, access to various simulation characteristics, such as pressure and velocity maps, is facilitated.

The conversion table then allows the transformation of dimensionless data into real-world values. This table is derived from Gabriel D. Weymouth's work, specifically from his Wiki on the Lilypad library.

## An Automated and Highly Dynamic Digital Twin Design with YOLOv8 for Hydrodynamic Studies on Living Animals.
The subsequent phase of this research entails generating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations closely aligned with real experiments. This involves extracting the fish from experiment videos, utilizing key features to construct a digital twin. The chosen CFD software for this purpose is LilyPad, also developed by Gabriel Weymouth. LilyPad, unlike other alternatives, employs point-based methods rather than functions for shape generation. A pipeline is developed to extract fish features using YOLOv8, automating the generation of a corresponding simulation. The fidelity of the digital twin is then assessed by comparing real pressure measurements from the sensors with those extracted from the simulation.

## HAACHAMA (Hydrodynamic Analysis for Automatic Creation of High-fidelity Analogous Models with AI)
The previous research has demonstrated promising outcomes with automated detection of fish-like objects. This study initially aims to compare the segmentation capabilities of YOLOv8 and more conventional Computer Vision tools like OpenCV. Given that YOLOv8 has shown superior performance, it will be utilized as the primary tool for the remainder of this research.

Another significant aspect involves evaluating the effectiveness of a dynamic Digital Twin (DT) created from experimental video footage, providing a baseline before automating DT generation. One approach is to manually construct a DT using the labels generated for YOLOv8 training. Essentially, to accelerate DT generation while maintaining high-quality results akin to manual design, it's imperative to understand the manual DT creation process. These manual labels can also serve as standalone DT representations. The resulting simulation exhibits promising alignment with real pressure signals from the experimental setup associated with the DT, accurately capturing key perturbations in terms of amplitude and timing.
