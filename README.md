The first part of this work aims at dimensionning the sensors that are going to be used in the water, to estimate the pressure generated by a swimming fish. To do so, we use a Julia library developped by Gabriel D Weymouth and called WaterLily. It allows us to generate the desired shape of a fish and to parametrise its speed and motion in a fluid. We can thus have access to most of the characteristics of the simulation, such as the pressure or the velocity map.

Thanks to the conversion table, it is then possible to convert the dimensionless data to real world values. This table has been based once again on Gabriel D Weymouth's work, this time beeing is Wiki about Lilypad library.
