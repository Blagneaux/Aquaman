## Dimensionning the sensors
The first part of this work aims at dimensionning the sensors that are going to be used in the water, to estimate the pressure generated by a swimming fish. To do so, we use a Julia library developped by Gabriel D Weymouth and called WaterLily. It allows us to generate the desired shape of a fish and to parametrise its speed and motion in a fluid. We can thus have access to most of the characteristics of the simulation, such as the pressure or the velocity map.

Thanks to the conversion table, it is then possible to convert the dimensionless data to real world values. This table has been based once again on Gabriel D Weymouth's work, this time beeing is Wiki about Lilypad library.

## An Automatic Highly Dynamical Digital Twin Design with YOLOv8 for hydrodynamic studies on living animals.
The second part of this work is to generate CFD simulations that match real experiments as much as possible. To do so, the idea is to extract the fish from a video of the experiment and use the main features to build a digital twin. The CFD software we decided to use is LilyPad, which is also developped by Gabriel Weymouth, but which is based on points to generate the shapes, instead of functions. A pipeline is developped to extract the features of the fish, by using YOLOv8, to automatically generate a matching simulation. Real pressure measured by the sensors, and pressure extracted from the simulation are then compared to evaluate how faithful the digital twin is.
